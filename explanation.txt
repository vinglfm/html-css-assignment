div has no default style;
	has no default meaning;
	can be used for any purposes.
span has no particular style;
	 has no particular meaning;
	 uses for a few words(keep a sentence in one line).
	

<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
    <style>
        p { color: red; }
        p { color: blue; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <p class="heading">Welcome!</p>
</body>
</html>	
In this kind of simple case, when more than one style rule is applied to the same element, the later the rule is listed, the higher precedence it has.
In this question, since the second p rule comes later than the first p rule, the second p rule has a higher precedence. Hence the paragraph text is in blue.

<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
    <style>
        p { color: red; }
        .heading { color: blue; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <p style="color: green" class="heading">Welcome!</p>
</body>
</html>
The inline style rule always has the highest precedence.

In this question, since there is an inline style rule applied to the paragraph, it has the highest precedence and overrides the p rule and the .heading rule defined in <style>. Hence the paragraph text is in green.
